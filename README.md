# Tienda Del Amazonas

## About

This is a Node/Express backend-application that allows users to create and track a simple online inventory. A view engine is implemented with JSX templates in order to generate a simple static site that serves as a user interface. Data is stored via MongoDB online.

## App Mechanics:

1. Two Players (User vs PC )
2. Win State
3. Lose State
4. Multiple Rounds
5. Exit Game
6. Play Again

## Additional Features

- Responsive mobile design
- Animation(s)
    - Flashing Background Color

## Known Issues:

- Edge case that errors exist on some diagonal searches for partial words (matrix out of bounds error?).
- I give the position of the start of the word, but is the position of the matrix and submatrix (X is the sub matrix (row) and starts from zero in the upper left hand corner. Y is the position in the row starting at zero from the left.)
- I do not yet cite the end position of the word
- Clicking Reset Board generates a random array and it can be searched ONCE. It then defaults back to the given array imported via the data.js file
PARROT is not found in the array. I believe it was a translation error as LORO is found and is the masculine translation of PARROT.

## Roadmap

- Add modal introduction and ending
- Add speed, weakness, and special attack to creatures
- Add additional animations
    1. Fade In/Out
    2. Border Flashing
    3. Shaking Image
    4. Screen Dimming
    5. Health Bar
- Refactor with TypeScript
